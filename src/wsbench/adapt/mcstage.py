"""``adapt mc model=<m> families=<f>[,<f>] [stage=build|subject]`` (plan 0060 A2, "Builders take
an adapted bank").

``stage=build`` (default): the family's own MC builders run on the ADAPTED-ONLY pending
candidates (``cand/<family>.jsonl`` rows not yet gated; originals keep the registered options and
are never touched), each with ``--bank`` (a work bank of those candidates) and an output under
``adapted/<m>/mc/<family>/`` (never ``evals/``: the builders refuse it). The built ``mc`` is
written into the candidate payloads in place (cand-row mode: ``store.add_candidates`` dedups by
id, so an append would be ignored), before ``gate``. A candidate the builder drops (association:
the gold lost the screen) loses its provisional ``mc``, so lint rejects it rather than gating an
unscreened list. Per family:

- association: ``association_distractors.py`` propose / screen / freeze, then
  ``mc_leakage_r4.py`` round 0 + freeze (the v3 leakage search);
- multihop: ``build_multihop_mc.py``, then ``mc_leakage_r4.py`` round 0 + freeze;
- basic_readout: ``mc_leakage_r4.py`` round 0 + freeze over the entity / processing candidates
  (an implicit item's gold is the subject's: its list is re-keyed after the gate, stage=subject);
- basic_readout_mt: ``r4_mc_distractors.py`` (pools) -> ``r4b_mc_refine.py`` ->
  ``build_r4b_mc_banks.py``; the provisional distractors the final list dropped become the
  item's ``hidden_rivals`` (the set's overlay file at freeze).

``stage=subject`` (basic_readout only): after the gate, the subject fields of every passing row
(``rebuild.subject_fields``).

Retained: distractors are never chosen from the subject's wrong answers (no builder sees them),
cannot-tell stays last (the judge adds it), and options are frozen in the item.
