"""A subject's native languages (plan 0060 A1.10): ``adapted/<model>/native_langs.json``.

``freeze`` writes ``contract.native_langs`` of the six families below from this file instead of
the registered header's Qwen value, and refuses those families until the file exists. File
format (one object)::

    {"model": "<key>", "native_langs": ["en", ...],   # ISO codes, English first
     "thinking": "on" | "off",                        # the mode the measurement ran in
     "method": "plan 0054 R6", "measured": "YYYY-MM-DD", "evidence": "<free text>"}

``measure`` runs plan 0054 R6 on the subject (a GPU job through the subject runner) and writes
the file; ``record`` writes a measurement made elsewhere, with its evidence. R6 (= plan 0032
§2.10) measures the reasoning TRACE, so ``measure`` defaults to thinking ON for a subject with a
thinking mode (``Subject.thinking_mode``) and falls back to the thinking-OFF response measure
(plan 0060 D7's variant) for one without; the record says which ran. The thinking-off variant
gave Qwen3.6-27B ['en'] (en .911, zh .037: it measures the ANSWER language), not R6's
['en', 'zh']. The second criterion (§2.10's "readouts", Camila 2026-11-03: the subject's
J-LENS, a token lens) is ``readout_criterion``: share of J-lens top-10 tokens per language at 10
read sites. native = English + both criteria (``combine``; ``native_by`` says which). On
Qwen3.6-27B: trace ['en'] (zh .0001), J-lens ['en', 'zh'] (zh .249) -> ['en', 'zh'].

Exception to copy-verbatim: when the subject's languages differ from the registered header's,
the ORIGINALS' native units are rebuilt per ``native_langs`` (plan 0054 §B) by the multilingual
upgraders (A2). Contract for an A2 multilingual upgrader, per original it rebuilds:

- set ``item[MARKER] = <the subject's native_langs>`` (``native_units_for``);
- rebuild EVERY unit (``units``: the native-role units AND the ``language`` unit, whose forms are
  keyed by native code) and ``probe_token_lens``;
- rebuild every native-dependent key the registered item has (``NATIVE_KEYS``: ``mc`` and
  ``mc_roles``, i.e. the native / language option blocks such as ``mc.correction_native``, and
  ``l2_equals_native`` / ``bridge_l2_creditable``);
- drop (never ship) an item whose L2 becomes native or stops being native, with that reason.

``freeze`` refuses a family whose passing originals are not marked for the subject's languages or
lack one of those keys (``unbuilt``), and otherwise takes them from the row (``overlay``)."""
