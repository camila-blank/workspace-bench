# plans/

Design plans for the 2026-09-15..17 restructure that gave the benchmark its nine-family shape
and shared package. Historical: they record what was decided then, not the current state.
Numbering gaps (0009, 0011) are plans that were reverted. Families added later and every
read-site change since are documented in the family READMEs (`evals/<family>/README.md`) and
the git log.

Later plans in this directory follow the same `NNNN-<name>.md` convention. 0032
(`0032-wsb-bp-infra.md`) is the shared read / summarize / judge machinery of the 2026-10-30 fix
campaign; 0033-0056 are that campaign's family workstreams, one plan per family PR.

The family PRs were written in parallel and several picked the same number; the integration merge
kept the number of the first-merged plan and renumbered the rest. Code, READMEs and tests of the
renumbered families were updated to the new number; an old number left in a shared doc, or in a
plan file (historical, not rewritten), means the plan below by family context:

Plans after the campaign:

| plan | family / scope |
|---|---|
| 0062 | `0062-nyt-connections.md`: the `nyt_connections` family (model-specific; ids-only NYT Connections bank v1, per-slot MC on the layered digest; bar = beat the prompt-only floor) |
| 0065 | `0065-math-shortcuts.md`: the `math_shortcuts` family (model-specific; Omni-MATH problems answered with no working, I = later explained by an illogical shortcut, N = validly; the frozen GUESS judge on the post-problem readouts; headline I − N flag rate). **Dropped 2026-11-05 (plan 0069).** |
| 0068 | `0068-buggy-leak-rubric.md`: buggy_code's adapt leak leg graded on the bug mechanism (`buggy_leak_mechanism` rubric), not as "the expected answer" of the whole cause (#289 L1); `adapt regrade legs=`; regrade of the shipped sets |
| 0069 | `0069-drop-math-shortcuts.md`: drop the `math_shortcuts` family (Camila 2026-11-05); a revert of #271 onto main, plan 0065 kept as history |
| 0072 | `0072-adapted-refresh-after-overhaul.md`: refresh the ten plan-0060 adapted sets after the 2026-11-05 overhaul (#295-#334, #344): impact per family, re-freeze order, new-item profiling, adapted option-list leak screen, floors after #350, GLM 4-lens re-judge, cost (draft) |
| 0081 | `0081-remove-unverbalized-hint.md`: remove the `unverbalized_hint` family (Camila 2026-11-07: outdated; retired since plan 0058): registry `REMOVED_FAMILIES`, code / bank / tests / examples / NOTICE section deleted, `RETIRED_FAMILIES` kept empty (tests on a stand-in) |
| 0085 | `0085-freeze-strict-ati.md`: the strict-ATI macro for Qwen3.6-27B frozen at 8 families (`ati-subset-v2`, Camila 2026-11-08): poetry admitted by exception, model_multihop's entry pinned from its family-specific panel run (`mmh_bridge`), nyt_connections and hinted_cutoff out |
| 0088 | `0088-glm-ati-subset.md`: GLM-5.3's committed ATI subsets (`adapted/glm-5.3`, Camila 2026-11-09): A (4-reader all-fail) default and B `with_qwen27b`; adapted macro exceptions per entry (poetry, wrong_intermediate, model_multihop); nyt_connections gated but off by default (`ati_opt_in=`, slot-id scope); GLM gate deviations recorded as provenance |
