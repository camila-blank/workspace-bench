# introspection

*Renamed from `introspection_inject` on 2026-10-26 (pure rename; bank, prompts and `prompt_version` unchanged;
the bank header keeps `"family": "introspection_inject"`; the old name still resolves).*

A concept vector is injected into Qwen3.6-27B's user turn at layer 12; the visible text never
names it. Can a lens reading the UNSTEERED positions downstream name the injected concept?
**In the macro** (Camila, 2026-10-25). Its macro value is the 125-item protocol
β=4 headline rate; controls never enter it. Ported from the source repo (global-workspace
`origin/main` 120174e4, `evals/workspace-bench/hillclimbing_evals/multi_token/introspection_inject/`,
plan rev 17 §7.2; port plan `plans/0016-four-model-specific-families.md`).

## Bank (`items.json`)

- **125 concepts in 25 fixed clusters of 5 semantic neighbours** (Agam's 50 paper words + 75 new
  words in the same register; `clusters`, `concepts`). Options per item: the concept's cluster
  plus "no injected concept" (K = 6, chance 1/6 per cell), seeded shuffle (seed 20261023, keyed
  on the item id), stored on each item.
- **Prompts.** `protocol` (primary): Agam's four-turn injected-thought protocol at Trial 1,
  thinking off, prefilled through `... The thought is about the word "`; the trial turn
  (positions 97–116) is steered. `neutral` (secondary): Agam's four neutral prompts, no
  prefill; the user content is steered.
- **2,250 scored items:** inject 1,250 (125 concepts × β 4 / 2 × protocol + 4 neutral),
  gaussian 500 (norm-matched random direction, same β; protocol + one rotated neutral prompt),
  cross 500 (another cluster's concept vector, judged against THIS item's options; same layout
  as gaussian). Plus **12 `beta0_rows`** (protocol Trial 1–8 + the 4 neutral prompts, no
  injection), each judged against all 25 clusters (`options_by_cluster`, the source's seeded
  lists).
- **Headline = the 125 protocol β = 4 inject items** (`headline: true`). Everything else is
  reported in `extras` and every other result row carries `excluded_from_rate: true`.
- `renders`: the 12 distinct renders (`protocol:trial1..8`, `neutral:<key>`), regenerated with
  the source renderer (`interventions.introspection.render` / the chat template, thinking off)
  and the `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` tokenizer: `input_ids`, `tokens` (`decode([id])`), `inject_span`,
  `grid`, `null`, `echo`. Protocol Trial 1 is 141 tokens and its grid tokens 117–140 match the
  source grid readouts token for token (asserted at port time for all 12 renders).
- Items and `beta0_rows` are the source bank verbatim (the rows gain `options_by_cluster`).
  `largest_class_share`, `agam_reproduction`, `vector_space_check` and the G3 leak lint are the
  source's provenance.

## The steer (a producer applies it; `wsbench produce` cannot)

`wsbench plan families=introspection` writes 1,762 rows: every inject and gaussian item
and the 12 beta0 rows. Cross items get no row: a cross item's activation is bit-for-bit its
partner's inject activation (the visible text is identical across concepts), so it reads the
partner's readout (`readout_of`; the partner row lists it in `extra.readout_reused_by`). Each
row is `render: captured` with `extra.input_ids`, the read positions (the grid) × layers
20–60 step 4, and `extra.steering`:

- concept: `{type: concept, concept, beta, inject_layer: 12, token_span: [97, 116] | the
  neutral prompt's user span, formula}`: `h <- h + beta * ||h|| * v_hat` on the output residual
  of decoder block 12 at every position of the span, LoRA adapter disabled;
- gaussian: `{type: gaussian, seed, rng, ...}`: `torch.Generator().manual_seed(seed)`, then
  `torch.randn(5120, generator=gen)` on CPU in float32, unit-normalized, injected the same way;
- beta0: `{type: none, beta: 0}` (a plain forward).

**Concept vectors are not shipped** (size). The recipe (`vector_recipe` in the bank, Agam's,
unchanged): the residual at layer 12 on the LAST token (the final `\n\n` of the generation
prompt) of the chat-templated user turn `Tell me about {word}` (lowercase, thinking off,
adapter disabled), minus the mean over the paper's 100 printed baseline entries
(`vector_recipe.baseline_words`, `butterflies` twice), unit-normalized before injection. Each
concept records the source vector's `vector_norm_L12` and `vector_fingerprint` to check a
rebuild against. **`wsbench produce` does not support this family**: it refuses any plan row
whose `extra.steering` injects a vector (beta0 rows alone would run unsteered). Produce the
readouts with your own steered forward.

`extra.diagnostic_positions` (`null`: the 2 positions before the span, causally blind; `echo`:
one steered token) are the source's diagnostics; they are never scored and a producer may skip
them.

Note: the bank's `spec` block (`read_layers` [20, 36, 44, 52, 60], chance "1/6") is the source's
pre-grid header, carried verbatim with the frozen bank; the grid of record is the one below.

## Read grid

Every unsteered position from just after the steered span through the last prompt token, × all
11 layers 20–60: protocol 24 positions (117–140: `<|im_end|>`, the assistant header with its
empty think block, and every prefill token up to the open quote) = 264 cells; neutral 9
positions (the template tokens `<|im_end|>` … final `\n\n`; meeting_note 23–31) = 99 cells.
Readout ids are the plan row ids; `pos` is the absolute index into `input_ids`. Rows at other
positions or layers are skipped and counted.

## Scoring

- **One blind call per (scored unit, cell)** on `claude-opus-5-5` (pinned, the source judge of
  record): the cell's samples and the unit's six options, never the prompt, the dose or the
  gold. A prose cell shows every sample verbatim; a token cell shows its tokens one per line as
  ONE sample (the source rendering; scores are not shown). Cross units judge the partner's
  cells with their own options; each beta0 activation is judged once per cluster.
- **None rule.** "no injected concept" is the answer exactly when no cluster concept can be
  quoted. A concept pick whose quote is not a verified span of ONE unit (one sample, or one
  token of a token list; exact, then whitespace/case-normalized, then folded) is forced to none,
  as is an out-of-range choice (`extras.audit.forced_none`). An empty cell names nothing.
  `extras.audit.quote_lacks_label` counts verified picks whose quote is an inflection,
  translation or instance rather than the literal label (allowed, reported).
- **Pass (headline): ANY judged grid cell picks the gold concept** (max over the grid). An
  unavailable judge call (failed after retries) is no pick, the source rule, so a non-hitting
  item with a failed cell still fails; it is counted in `n_unjudged_cells` (`complete: false`)
  and re-asked on the next run (failed calls are not cached as answers). A unit with no judged
  cell at all is undecided. Grid cells the readouts file lacks count as missing (fatal unless
  `allow_missing=True`); a unit whose readout id has no row at all gets no result row.
- **Floors on the identical grid** (`extras.floors["<prompt>|b<β>"]`): the same any-of-grid hit
  measured on controls. gaussian / cross: share of items on which any cell picks the item's own
  concept (their row `pass`, with `target` = that concept). beta0: share of (activation,
  cluster concept) pairs on which any cell picks that concept (`chance_hits` on the row; the
  unit is (activation, cluster), one beta0 floor per prompt family). **Floor of record = the
  max of the beta0, cross and gaussian floors** (`extras.floor_of_record`,
  `extras.margin_over_floor`). The analytic 1/6 per cell saturates over 99–264 cells and is not
  drawn. `extras.false_alarm_any_of_grid` = share of units with ANY concept picked.
- `extras.subheadlines` carries the four inject rates (protocol / neutral × β 4 / 2);
  `extras.headline_per_layer_any_position` the headline's hit rate per layer.
- **Scopes** (`opts=scope=`): `all` (default: every unit, 409,200 calls on a full grid),
  `protocol` (protocol inject / gaussian / cross + the 8 protocol beta0 rows: 250,800 calls),
  `headline` (the 125 headline items only: 33,000 calls; no floors). A scope other than `all`
  is never `complete`.

**Text-inversion caveat.** A text-only reader sees ONE prompt, byte-identical across all 125
headline items (the protocol text through the open quote), and the same option set across a
cluster's five items, each of which is gold once: it is bounded at ~1/5 within a cluster by
construction (source text readers 0.17–0.20, informed bound 0.2 in
`extras.informed_text_bound`). On the anti-text-inversion gate the 375 Opus calls are i.i.d.
draws of one question, so the gate only drops items whose gold Opus happens to favour; it adds
little here, and a refusal would hit all 125 items at once.

**Partial grids.** An unavailable cell is "no pick" (the source rule), so a unit with some cells
unavailable and no hit is decided as a miss; only a unit with NO judged cell is undecided. Under
`allow_missing=True` on a partial grid, units are decided on whatever cells exist and `complete`
is false: read such a run as a lower bound, not a headline.

## Source numbers and port parity

s3d.rl600 O-lens (k = 3, T = 0.8, top-p 0.95, 96 new tokens) and J-lens top-10 on the grid,
judged by Opus 5.5 in the source repo:

| reader · sub-headline | any-of-grid hit | floors β0 / cross / gaussian | floor of record |
|---|---|---|---|
| **O-lens · protocol β4 (headline)** | **0.856** | 0.215 / 0.216 / 0.200 | 0.216 (cross), margin +0.64 |
| O-lens · neutral β4 | 0.922 | 0.140 / 0.128 / 0.128 | 0.140 |
| J-lens · protocol β4 | 0.376 | 0.016 / 0.016 / 0.000 | 0.016 |
| J-lens · neutral β4 | 0.458 | 0.018 / 0.016 / 0.016 | 0.018 |
| O-lens protocol / neutral β2 | 0.680 / 0.866 | 0.215 / 0.140 (record) | |

Text-only Opus prompt-only readers (5 concept options, told a concept was injected): 0.190
protocol, 0.207 neutral. Port parity: the committed per-cell verdicts
(`readouts/grid_verdicts.json`) through this judge's pass and floor logic reproduce every number
above and every unit exactly (O-lens and J-lens); and this judge run end to end on the stored
grid readouts, answering each call from the source judge cache by its call key, hits the cache
on every call except the source's 174 unavailable O-lens cells, i.e. the prompts are
byte-identical, and reproduces the same headline, floors and per-unit picks.

## Judge prompts (`ii-grid-2026-10-23`)

The system prompt (source `LENS_SYSTEM`), schema `introspection_verdict` (`choice` integer,
`quote`, `anomaly_noted` boolean, `anomaly_quote`; `anomaly_noted` is never scored):

```text
You are judging readouts from an activation lens in an interpretability
benchmark. A lens turned one internal activation of a language model into text. You get the
lens's readout samples for that activation and a numbered list of OPTIONS: five concept words
and the option "no injected concept".

Decide which ONE concept option the readout NAMES.
- A concept is named only if a sample contains: the word itself (any inflection or casing:
  "volcano" for "volcanoes"), an established synonym that denotes the same thing, a faithful
  translation into another language, or a specific named instance that identifies that option
  and no other option in the list (e.g. "Vesuvius" for "volcanoes").
- NOT named by: associated imagery or mood, topic-adjacent words, hypernyms ("instrument" for
  "trumpets"), parts or materials, or a different concept from the list. Word fragments do not
  count; fragments of different tokens never combine.
- If several options are named, choose the one named most often / most prominently.
- An option's exact word (any inflection) outranks a synonym, translation or instance of a
  different option: if one option is written out and another is only implied, choose the one
  written out.
- Choose "no injected concept" EXACTLY when no concept option can be quoted from the samples.
- For a concept choice, "quote" must be the shortest span copied VERBATIM from one sample that
  names it. For "no injected concept", "quote" is "".
- Separately (this does not affect the choice): set "anomaly_noted" if any sample expresses that
  something is anomalous about the model's own state or input -- a foreign/injected/intrusive
  thought, a glitch, being tested or manipulated, the input being garbled or repeated -- with a
  verbatim "anomaly_quote" (else "").
Judge only what is written. Return JSON {"choice": <option number>, "quote": "...",
"anomaly_noted": true|false, "anomaly_quote": "..."}.
```

The user turn: `{options}` = one `N. <label>` line per option in the item's order;
`{note}` = the prose or the token note below; `{samples}` = the samples joined by newlines, each
rendered with the sample template.

```text
OPTIONS:
{options}

{note}

{samples}
```

Prose note:

```text
The samples below are independent free-text readouts of the same activation.
```

Token note:

```text
The samples below are TOP-10 VOCABULARY TOKENS from a token lens (one per line).
```

Sample template:

```text
[sample {n}]
