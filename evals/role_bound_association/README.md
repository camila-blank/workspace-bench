# Role-bound association

In-house family (no external source). A scene conveys a directed relation ("Marcus … chased
Dylan") with the role words blocked; does the lens bind the direction — who did what to whom —
and not just the concepts?

**The rule (plan 0055, `PROMPT_VERSION = "oa-v2.4"`).** An item passes only if ONE
statement of the readouts, on its own, names the agent, the action and the patient and states
the direction, and the judge's quote of that statement survives a mechanical gate.

- A **sample** is what the producer's sidecar declares (`sampling`, plan 0032 §2.9): one
  s3d-rl600 or NLA generation (`prose1`), one generation of a single-bullet `*-x4` arm
  (`bullet4`: 4 separate samples per activation), or one ranked top-10 token list (`tokens10`).
- A **statement** is the unit a relation must sit in: one top-level `- ` bullet of a prose
  sample (or the whole sample if it has no top-level bullets), or one ranked token list. In
  digest lines the bullets of one sample are joined by `⁞` (`digest.BULLET_MARK`), so the judge
  sees where one statement ends.
- Content from different samples, bullets, positions or layers is never pieced together into a
  relation (Camila, 2026-10-30: "we should require the roles and action to be in the same
  readout"). A neighbouring role is a different person: "grandmother" never passes for a gold
  "parent", "mother" never for a gold "grandparent".

- **Bank:** `items.json`, 100 items (50 `pair_id`s × `direction` ab / ba; strata
  `stereotypicality` ∈ congruent 39 / incongruent 39 / neutral 22), verbatim copy of the source
  repo's `…/role_bound_association/items.json`; unchanged by oa-v2.1 (no new bank version; the ATI
  `bank_sha` is unchanged).
- **Role lexicon:** `roles_v1.json` (instrument data, stamped `config.roles_lexicon =
  "roles-v1"`): for each of the 93 bank roles, `terms` (the role, plural, synonyms,
  gendered and informal forms, scene hyponyms such as "swimmer" for an athlete, and listed
  Chinese forms) and `near` (2-4 different but confusable roles: parent → grandparent /
  stepparent / guardian; teacher → principal / social worker / tutor / professor). Drafted by
  `claude-opus-5-5` (`scripts/author_roles_lexicon.py`; the raw draft is kept outside the repo),
  reviewed by hand (toddler / child / parent / grandparent / teacher / doctor / son / mother /
  guard / police officer edited to the plan's examples; two overlapping forms dropped) and held
  by `tests/test_role_bound_lexicon.py` (every bank role has terms; near roles share no term with
  the role; the five people of every v2 list are pairwise term-disjoint; no role term occurs in
  its own item's role-word-blocked stimulus). A top-level `block` map lists mask-only forms of
  neighbouring kin roles in spaced and CJK spellings ("great grandmother", 曾祖母, "step
  mother", "foster father", "son in law", 表兄弟): never options or role terms, only masked
  by the gate. An edit bumps the `version` field.
- **Read regime (producer side):** the stimulus is chat-rendered with
  `"\n\nSummarize the preceding story in one sentence."` appended, and the lens is read at the
  19 suffix and chat-tail positions (`Sum mar ize the preceding story in one sentence .` +
  `<|im_end|> \n <|im_start|> assistant \n <think> \n\n </think> \n\n`) at every layer of
  `readplan.GRID` (20..60 step 4, 11 layers). Story positions are never read.
  `reads=full` requires that span per (item, layer): `EvalSpec.min_full_positions = 19`,
  `full_contiguous = True` (`reads.check_full`, inside `reads.load`). **Lite** (`reads=lite`):
  the frozen rule of `readplan.frozen_lite_rule` — `final_token` until the pre-registered
  support-share procedure (`scripts/lite_site_table.py`, gpu runbook R4d; candidates
  `final_token`, the top-3 `offset_from_end` k by pooled support share, and `offset_from_end
  k=4`, the `\n` after `assistant`; switch only on > 10 points of share, pass rates never
  consulted) freezes one into `evals/role_bound_association/lite_rule.json`; lite results stamp
  `config.lite_rule`.
- **Story-echo guard:** after `reads.load`, per (item, layer), cells read before the position
  whose token run starts the suffix text are story positions: exit 2 ("readouts carry positions
  before the summarize suffix"), or under `allow_missing=True` dropped and counted in
  `extras.n_rows_outside_span`. Cells without `token` are kept and counted in
  `n_span_unverified`; a `prompt_only:*` reader is skipped.
- **Judge:** `claude-opus-5-5` (the repo default; summarizer Opus 5.5, `task` variant),
  `PROMPT_VERSION = "oa-v2.4"`. Under summary mode the stamp is
  `reads.stamp(digest.prompt_version("oa-v2.4", args, family), reads.mode(args))`
  (defaults: `oa-v2.4+digest-v4-task-extractive+sj-v9`; `+reads-lite` under lite).
- **The prompt-only baseline is not a bar here.** The scene states who did what to whom, so the
  `po-opus-v1` floor (one Opus readout per id, judged through this same digest, SYSTEM, v2 lists
  and gate) is expected near 1.0 and is frozen with `saturated: true`: a fairness flag on the
  bank, never a floor a lens must clear. The Gemini-era `prompt_only.json` entry (oa-v1, 1.00)
  is history.
- **Macro:** in (`metric = "pass_rate"`, `not_in_macro = ""`).

## Summary mode (the default)

Every read site of an item (every layer, every position) goes to ONE digest call
(`wsbench.digest.collapse`, `task_note = EvalSpec.task_note`, `expect_all` = the loaded span),
and the three MCs (agent / action / patient) are asked once, in one call keyed `<id>|L-1`, on
that digest (`USER_SUMMARY`: the digest note, then the digest as the `READOUT`).

- **Binding is per statement, not per digest.** The three answers must come from ONE digest
  line, and within it from one `⁞`-delimited bullet; the gate below enforces it. (The oa-v1 text
  "agent and patient read at different sites can pass together" is withdrawn.)
- **Item states.** An item with no readouts is a rowless fail. An unsummarized item (digest
  call failed, unparsable, or every evidence span failed verification), or one whose call failed,
  is a fail counted in `n_unjudged_cells`; an empty item is a fail with no call, counted in
  `n_empty_cells`. Every collapsed item has one row (`judged` marks whether the call landed).
- **Counts.** `n_expected_cells` stays the native site count; `n_unjudged_cells` /
  `n_empty_cells` count items. `pinned_instrument` also requires the digest's default model and
  effort. Token files are digested like every other method (no interpretation step); the shared
  token-list rule rendered from this family's spec is added to the note.
- `chance = (1/6)^3` (one call per item, no grid); `any_of_grid_floor` / `sites_per_item` /
  the layer-pick columns are native-only.

**Native** (`opts=aggregate=native`) is the ablation: one call per non-empty cell, the cell's
readout in place of the digest (`prose1`: the generation as written, bullets intact;
`bullet4`: one `- ` line per generation, `readouts.bulleted`; tokens: the raw ranked list
`render_bag(tokens)` followed by the token-list rule, `USER_TOKENS`). Site pass = the gated rule
below; item pass = any site. `layers=all|each|<csv>` restricts or splits layers.

## Pass rule and gate

A row passes iff all three picks are gold AND `gate_ok` (`gate.py`; `lines` =
`col.evidence[id]` in summary mode, `digest.native_lines([cell])` natively):

1. **(a) quote verified** by the ONE shared verifier `digest.quote_ok(quote, lines)` (a prose
   quote inside one sample; a token quote = whole tokens of ONE list joined by `" | "`, or one
   word spelled across adjacent positions of one layer);
2. **(a′) within one statement**: `digest.quote_ok(quote, digest.statement_lines(lines,
   cells))` — a quote copied across a `⁞` passes (a) and fails here, counted in the shared
   `extras.n_unverified_bullet`;
3. **(b) the quote refers to the gold agent AND the gold patient**: by name or by a role term.
   - **Name**: a *capitalised* word that is the exact name, or a variant of it: ≥ 4 letters,
     same first 4 letters (casefolded), within 2 edits, not a word of any lexicon / near-role
     term and not a month or weekday. So "Marc" / "Marco" name Marcus and "Mark" does not, while
     "victim" / "Victim" never name Victor, "miles" never Miles, "Grandmother" never Grant,
     "Devoted" never Devon, "March" never Marcus. Residual: a capitalised sentence-initial
     common word within 2 edits of a name ("Device" / Devin) still counts.
     **A name never stands for the gold role when the quote attaches a conflicting role to it**
     (oa-v2.3, `gate.conflicting_role`; oa-v2.4 widens "conflicting"). Conflicting = a Latin term of one of the gold role's
     listed `near` roles (the lexicon's close distractors: parent / uncle / aunt for a
     grandparent; a near role whose terms overlap the gold's, child for a gold grandson, is
     compatible) or a `block` kin form (great- / step- / foster- / -in-law; hyphenated or joined
     spellings too: "mother-in-law", "stepmother"); inflected forms ("auntie") count. Attached =
     right before the name ("Aunt Ruth", "her mom Ruth", "her aunt, Ruth"), or after it as an
     appositive or predicate within 4 words ("Ruth, her mother", "Ruth (her mom)", "Ruth, Mia's
     aunt", "Ruth, a loving mother", "Ruth is her aunt", "Ruth the aunt"); a conjunction or
     preposition, a sentence break, or a participle before a possessive ends it ("Ruth and her
     mother", "Mia, hugging her mother", "Mia's mother"). A plain name, a name with its own role
     ("Grandma Ruth") or with a compatible / non-near role ("Diane, the parent" for a gold
     mother, "Kyle, the boy" for a gold son) resolves as before. Residuals: a correct relational
     description through a near-role word ("Ruth, the mother of her father") is rejected, and
     CJK kin suffixes (Ruth阿姨) are not read.
   - **Role term**: `mc.form_in` over `roles_v1.json` terms (Latin word-bounded, CJK only as
     listed forms), hyphenated compounds read as one word on both sides. An own-term hit does
     not count when it lies strictly inside a LONGER occurrence of a different lexicon or
     near role's term: "security guard" never names a gold "guard", "step-mother" /
     "mother-in-law" never a gold "mother", "baby-sitter" is "babysitter"; the lexicon's `block`
     forms are masked too, so "great grandmother" / 曾祖母 never name a gold "grandparent" and
     "step mother" / "foster mother" never a gold "parent". A shorter
     other-role term never blocks a longer own one: "star player" names `star starter` even
     though "player" is another role's term, and 窃贼 names `burglar` despite 贼.

4. **(c) the quote states the gold action** (oa-v2.4, `gate.action_ref`): one of its forms in
   `actions_v1.json` (inflections and clear synonyms, English word-bounded; CJK forms are whole
   words of two or more characters, so 抱歉 never states hugged; a form starting with `re:` is a
   context-bound regular expression: "lies to";
   "pursued" for chased, "felt sorry for" / 可怜 for pitied). Generic forms that do not state the
   action in context are not listed ("orders", "a fee", "questions", "report", "follow", "lie").
   Generic-sense synonyms (`needs_object`: fine, mad, save, charge, trail, shadow, tail, fed, snap,
   thanks, bow, train, pads, dismissed, 报告, 跟着, and every inflection of a generic verb: saved,
   directed, questioned, calmed, followed, reported) count only with the person acted on (name,
   role term or a pronoun) as their object in the same clause: a direct object, with an optional
   -ly adverb, one determiner and up to two modifiers between ("fines the forgetful borrower",
   "bowing deeply to his humble common servant"), after a preposition only where the action's
   `object_preps` lists it ("mad at him", "bowed to the king"), or, for a `passive` form, before
   it ("Otto was fed by Maya"). "she is fine", "fine with him", "in charge of her", "a hiking
   trail", "on the train", "snapped at the waiter", "followed by a long silence", "it was
   reported that ..." never count. A related but different action
   never counts: "empathy" for pitied, "reprimands" for yelled at, "no hug back" for hugged.
   actions-v1.3 (round 3): a `split_object` phrasal verb counts only with the person acted on
   between verb and particle ("kicked him out", "ripped the supplier off", "patted her down",
   "turned the dean in", "put him at ease", "told the nurse to"; never "threw the trash out");
   "report to" / "reports to" / "to report" are gone (the dean reported TO is not the dean
   reported: "resolved to report academic misconduct to the Dean" never states it), and 训练 and
   "questioning" are object-bound (训练营, "questioning his own memory" never count). A
   `needs_object` object may sit in a verbal appositive ("questioning a former neighbor serving
   as a witness"). For a split or multi-word form an object word followed by 's is a possessor,
   not the object ("took a picture of the visitor's car").
   The r1 re-audit found about 7 of 54 prompt-only passes resting on an implied relation or a
   related action, and lens cases of the same shape.
5. **oa-v2.4 conflicting roles also include**, for a kin role, its converse kin words
   (`gate.CONVERSE_KIN`: "Ruth, her daughter" never names a gold grandparent; "Dale, his bride"
   never a gold husband). The OTHER gold person's role terms (converse kin included) are dropped
   from the conflict set ("Marcus, who chases the thief Dylan" names the officer Marcus; "Ruth, who
   hugs her grandson Mia" the grandparent Ruth). A token-list separator ends an attachment ("aunt |
   Ruth" attaches nothing; one token "Aunt Ruth" does). Words are split at Latin / CJK boundaries
   first ("Marcus暗中-tailed" reads "Marcus").
6. **(d) the quote gives no different kin relation** (round 3, `gate.relation_conflict`,
   `relation_ok`): a possessive kin phrase ("her daughter", "Marta's son", "his bride") whose
   possessor is a gold person must fit the gold pair (its word a term of the other person's role,
   its converse a term of the possessor's) whenever it refers to the counterpart: its word is a
   gold role's term ("Marcus flipped out at his bride" makes the caterer a groom), or both gold
   roles are kin and the counterpart is unnamed or named right after it ("Marta ... her
   daughter's return ... embrace the girl" makes the grandparent a parent). A fitting phrase
   anywhere in the quote ("her granddaughter") clears it; a third person's kin ("Martin and his
   wife worried about Elise", "the bride and her mother") never conflicts. Latin only. The
   re-ask also fires when the quote gives the two picked people a different kin relation.

Direction stays with the judge. These family conditions only ever reject on top of the shared
rules (add, never relax).

**One re-ask (oa-v2.4, summary mode).** When all three picks are substantive and the judge's
own quote does not support its OWN picks (not verbatim, across two statements, a picked person
not named in it by name, role or a term shown beside its option, or the picked action not stated
in it: `judge.pick_problems` / `judge.option_named`, the same rule for every option, never which
option is gold), the item is asked once more with `RETRY` appended to its own user turn; the
second answer replaces the first (kept in `rows[].retry_of`), is gated the same way and is
never re-asked. This catches judge index slips (oa-police-thief-chase-ab: evidence maps
"robber" to the thief but Q3 picked the heiress) and weak quotes chosen over a clean digest
line.

**Two-person + action pins (oa-v2.4, summary mode).** Before the MC call, up to `PIN_MAX = 15`
raw statements naming two of the SHOWN people (`judge.option_named`: name, role or a shown term)
and one of the SHOWN actions
are appended to the item's digest (`judge._pin_two_person_lines`, `digest.pin_lines`: most
repeated first; the same rule for every option, never told the gold), so a rare passing line
the digest dropped reaches the judge.

verbatim.

### `SYSTEM`

```text
You judge readouts of a language model's internal activations: noisy free text, or ranked lists of top vocabulary tokens, decoded while the model read a short story in which one person does something to another. Answer the three multiple-choice questions under these rules.
1. One statement at a time. A statement is one line of the readouts: one '- ' bullet of a free-text sample (or the whole sample if it has no bullets), or one ranked token list. In a free-text sample, bullets are separated by ⁞; each part between ⁞ marks is its own statement. All three answers must come from the SAME statement, and that statement must itself name the person who acts, the action, and the person acted on, and say which way the action goes. Never combine people, actions or directions taken from different statements, bullets, samples, positions or layers, even when together they would fit an option. If no single statement settles a question, answer "cannot tell from the readout" for it.
2. Exact people. A person matches an option only if the statement gives that person's name (partial names such as 'Marc' for 'Marcus' count) or that person's role, in the same or a synonymous or gendered form ('mom' or '母亲' for a mother, 'cop' for a police officer). A neighbouring but different role is a different person: 'grandmother' is not 'parent', 'mother' is not 'grandparent', 'social worker' is not 'teacher', 'nurse' is not 'doctor'. Never pick an option because it is the closest one, or the only one of its kind. An option may list, after 'also:', other names of its role; each of them names that option's role. A person the statement calls by a different proper name but by that option's role (or one of its listed names) is that option's person, unless the name is another option's.
3. Exact action. The statement must state the action, with the same verb or a clear synonym ('pursued' for 'chased'). A related but different action ('watched' for 'spied on', 'confronted' for 'blamed') does not match.
4. Direction. Who is the agent and who is the patient must come from what the statement says, never from what is typical. Tokens of ONE ranked list may be read together to express one meaning, and tokens of adjacent positions at the same layer only to spell one word or name split across them; nothing else combines. A ranked token list names concepts, not who did what to whom: unless a token in it itself states the direction, answer "cannot tell from the readout" for Q1 and Q3 from a token list. A token list that holds two or more of the options singles out none of them, whatever their rank; a list that is a run of people or roles of one kind (relatives, professions, names, ...) singles out none of them, whatever their rank, even when only one of them is an option; otherwise an option that is the only option on its list is singled out by that list.
5. Do not use world knowledge or plausibility to fill gaps. If the readouts do not support an answer, choose "cannot tell from the readout".
Then give "quote": a span copied character for character from the ONE statement your answers come from, never across a ⁞ mark (from a token list, its tokens joined by " | "; a word spelled across adjacent positions, as that plain word), without any bracketed marker. Give "" if you answered "cannot tell from the readout" to any question.
```

### `RETRY` (oa-v2.4)

```text


Your previous answer (Q1 = {q1}, Q2 = {q2}, Q3 = {q3}) quoted:
"{quote}"
It was rejected: {problems}. Answer again from the same readouts. Choose ONE statement that itself names the person who acts, the action and the person acted on, quote it exactly, and answer from it; if no single statement settles a question, answer "{cannot}" for it.
```

### `HEADER`

Rendered with `str.replace` only: the literal `{person A} -> {action} -> {person B}` is part of the prompt, not a placeholder.

```text
One statement may describe two people; the sentence it states has the form {person A} -> {action} -> {person B}. People may be referred to by name or role.
```

### `Q1`

```text
Q1. Who performs the action (the agent)?
```

### `Q2`

```text
Q2. What is the action or state?
```

### `Q3`

```text
Q3. Who is the action directed at (the patient)?
```

### `MC_BLOCK`

One MC question: `{question}` = Q1 / Q2 / Q3, `{listing}` = its numbered option list.

```text
{question}
{listing}
```

### `BLOCK`

The per-item question block (identical across layers and positions).

```text
{header}

{q1}

{q2}

{q3}
```

### `USER`

Native prose: `{readout}` = the cell's readout, `{block}` = the rendered block.

```text
READOUT:
{readout}

{block}
```

### `USER_TOKENS`

Native tokens: `{readout}` = the cell's ranked list (`tok | tok | …`, no scores), `{note}` =
`TOKEN_NOTE`.

```text
READOUT:
{readout}

{note}

{block}
```

### `USER_SUMMARY`

`{note}` = the digest note below (plus `TOKEN_NOTE` after a newline for a token file),
`{readout}` = the item's digest, `{block}` = the rendered `BLOCK`.

```text
{note}

READOUT:
{readout}

{block}
```

### `SUMMARY_NOTE`

The digest note (`summ_render=extractive`, the default).

```text
The readout below is a digest of the readouts across every read layer and position: for each read layer, a note-taker who did not see the passage picked the most prominent readout samples, then samples carrying content seen in only one or a few samples, and the layers' picks are merged, the most-stated first. Each line is marked with how many readout samples state its content ([N samples], or [N samples, M layers] when it was seen at M read layers): counted per claim, so a sample that only lists the word among others of its kind, or only restates the question, is not counted; compare these counts when weighing lines against each other. Each line is one real readout sample (a free-text generation, or one ranked list of top tokens). Treat each line as a separate sample: pieces on different lines never combine. Any quote must be copied from inside one line, without the bracketed marker.
```

### `SUMMARY_NOTE_ABSTRACTIVE`

`{note}` under `summ_render=abstractive` (ablation).

```text
The readout below is a digest of the readouts across every read layer and position, written layer by layer by a note-taker who did not see the passage, most prominent first, then content seen in only one or a few samples. Each line is one statement in the note-taker's words, how many samples state it (counted per claim), and a verbatim evidence span from one real readout sample. The statements are not evidence: judge what the evidence spans show, treat each line as a separate sample (pieces on different lines never combine), and copy any quote from inside one evidence span.
```

### `TOKEN_NOTE`

`mc.token_note(SPEC.flat_types, multi_select=SPEC.multi_select)`; this family declares
`flat_types = ()` and `multi_select = False`, so it equals `mc.token_note()`. SYSTEM rule 4 adds
on top of it: a token list gives no Q1 / Q3 answer unless a token itself states the direction.

```text
A line whose items are separated by " | " is one ranked list of the top vocabulary tokens read from ONE activation, best first. Several tokens of the same line may jointly express one meaning, and a quote from such a line is one token or several tokens of that same line joined by " | ". Tokens of adjacent positions at the same layer may be joined only to spell one word split across them; such a quote is that word. Tokens on different lines never combine otherwise, and a relation (who does what to whom) must be stated within one sample (for a free-text sample, within one of its "- " bullets; in a free-text sample, bullets are separated by ⁞). A line that holds two or more of the options singles out none of those options, whatever their rank. A line that holds a run of interchangeable words or names of one kind (numbers, months, colours, countries, cities, people, works, ...) singles out none of the words on it, whatever their rank, even when only one of them is an option. Otherwise, an option that is the only option on its line is singled out by it.
```

### `DIGEST_TASK_NOTE`

`EvalSpec.task_note`, the task-type sentence the digest's `task` variant is told (no roles,
names, action or gold).

```text
the model read a short story in which one person does something to another person, and was then asked to summarize the story in one sentence
```

### Output schema

`schema_block("readout_mc", …)` — `quote` is the span the gate checks, `evidence` the free-text
reason (audit only):

```json
{
 "name": "readout_mc",
 "strict": true,
 "schema": {
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": [
   "q1_choice",
   "q2_choice",
   "q3_choice",
   "quote",
   "evidence"
  ],
  "properties": {
   "q1_choice": {
    "type": "integer"
   },
   "q2_choice": {
    "type": "integer"
   },
   "q3_choice": {
    "type": "integer"
   },
   "quote": {
    "type": "string"
   },
   "evidence": {
    "type": "string"
   }
  }
 }
}
```

## Option lists (oa-v2.1; oa-v2.2 adds the "also:" terms)

Each MC has six lines: five options seeded-shuffled + `cannot tell from the readout` last
(`mc.options_with_cannot`).

- People (`build_block_v2`): the item's two people `f"{name}, the {role}"`; a **near-role
  distractor** for each of role_a and role_b (the first `near` entry, in lexicon order, that is
  not an item role and passes the constraints; its name drawn from the bank's name pool); one
  random other-pair `a`-label. Constraints, by seeded rejection: no two labels identical, no two
  names sharing their first 4 letters (casefolded), no option role equal to or term-overlapping
  another's. Q1 and Q3 are independent shuffles of the same five people.
- Actions: gold + 4 drawn from the actions of pairs that share no role with the item
  (near-action distractors are not used: the bank's near actions are often synonyms).
- Seeds: `rng = Random(seed_int(f"{DATASET_SEED}:d2:{id}"))`; shuffles
  `f"{DATASET_SEED}:{id}:v2:q1|q2|q3"`; `DATASET_SEED = 20260810`. Pinned by
  `tests/golden/role_bound_association_options_v2.json`.
- Example (`oa-child-grandparent-hug-ab`): Mia, the child · Ruth, the grandparent · Odile, the
  parent · Dennis, the uncle · Dario, the celebrity. oa-v1 had no near role, listed
  `oa-doctor-nurse-instruct-ab`'s gold patient "Priya, the nurse" twice, and 57/100 of its
  lists held two names sharing their first 4 letters.
- `build_block` (the oa-v1 builder, `HEADER_V1`) is kept unchanged for source parity
  (`tests/golden/role_bound_association_options.json`); no judge path uses it.

## Verdict rows and extras

Native rows: `{key, id, layer, pos, choices, correct: [q1, q2, q3], reversed, quote, gate:
{quote_ok, one_statement, agent_ref, patient_ref}, gate_ok, pass, evidence}`; summary rows add
`judged` and the digest's `summary*` fields.

`extras`: `n_api_failed`, `by_stereotypicality {congruent | incongruent | neutral: {n, pass}}`,
`incongruent_pass_rate` (shown beside the headline), `n_gate_rejected` (gold triples the gate
failed) with sub-counts `n_quote_unverified` (a), `n_unverified_bullet` (a′),
`n_agent_unreferenced` / `n_patient_unreferenced` (b), `n_reversed` (items with a row whose
Q2 is gold and Q1 / Q3 name the gold patient / agent: the right relation, wrong direction),
`n_rows_outside_span`, `n_span_unverified`, `n_roles_unlexiconed` (adapted banks). Native also:
`any_of_grid_floor` (do not quote: it saturates), `sites_per_item`, and
`mcjudge.layer_pick_columns` (`n_items_gold_any_layer`, `n_items_distractor_any_layer`,
`n_items_distractor_majority`). Summary: `summary` (the digest's extras incl.
`digest_served_by`). `config` adds `roles_lexicon` and the shared `reads` / `sampling` /
`reader` / `reads_checked` / `layers_judged` stamps.

## Failure accounting

`n_missing_cells` is 0 (the bank carries no position list); a short span exits 2 under
`reads=full` unless `allow_missing=True` (then `extras.partial_ids`). `n_empty_cells` counts
selected cells whose readout text is empty — never judged. `n_unjudged_cells` counts selected
non-empty cells that got no verdict; an in-scope item with no judged cell counts as a fail.
Verdicts are cached append-only in `<out>/cells.jsonl`, keyed by the call key and a fingerprint
of `(PROMPT_VERSION, judge model, reasoning, system, user)`; rerunning retries only failures.

## Adapted banks

An authored item whose role is not in `roles_v1.json` is flagged by `adapt/lint.py` ("lexicon:
role … not in roles_v1.json"); the builder falls back to `terms=[role]` with no near-role
distractor for it (an other-pair label instead), counted in `extras.n_roles_unlexiconed`.
`min_full_positions = 19` is the Qwen chat-tail length: an adapted subject with a shorter tail
runs with `allow_missing` (partial) until its bank header is measured.

## History

- oa-v1 (2026-09 .. 2026-10-30): the source script's prompt
  (`scripts/oracle_lens_evals/oa_eb_readout_judge.py`), no quote, no gate, three random
  other-pair people distractors, a J-lens interpretation step for token files (deleted, plan
  0032 §2.3), summary binding at digest level. The cached audit showed both leniencies Camila
  flagged: content stitched across samples / bullets (21 of 72 summary passes said so in their
  own evidence) and close roles accepted as "the closest listed option" (`oa-teacher-parent-
  blame-ab`: "social worker" → the teacher). oa-v2.1 is plan 0055.
- oa-v2.2 (2026-10-31, audit fix F5): each person option lists its role's other names, `Walter, the homeowner (also: house owner, resident, occupant)` (English `roles_v1.json` terms; `display_terms_v1.json` for the near roles the lexicon lacks, display only, never read by the gate; spelling variants dropped, a term two options share shown for neither, at most 6), and SYSTEM rule 2 says a person called by a different proper name but by an option's role is that option's person unless the name is another option's. Option order and gold positions are unchanged.
- oa-v2.3 (2026-10-31, pre-rejudge fix): the gate rejects a name the quote attaches a conflicting (near-role or block kin) role to ("Aunt Ruth" or "Ruth, her mother" for a gold grandparent, "Dale, who works as a receptionist" for a gold client; `gate.conflicting_role`). Prompt text, option lists and gold positions are unchanged.
- oa-v2.4 (2026-10-31, final r1): the gate also needs the gold action stated in the quote (`actions_v1.json`); conflicting roles add converse kin (never the counterpart's role); Latin / CJK words split at the script boundary; roles-v1.1 adds "suspected <noun>" forms for suspect and "new hire" / "new employee" for recruit, roles-v1.2 gives the 38 near-role distractors without one a lexicon entry (plural and CJK forms; shown in the "also:" lists; option order and gold positions unchanged); roles-v1.3 gives the six shown distractors still without one a CJK form (grandfather, sibling, shopkeeper, bishop, chauffeur, audience member) and grandfather its grandpa forms; the action lexicon (actions-v1.1) makes every generic-sense form and inflection (saved, directed, questioned, calmed, followed, reported, ...) object-bound: a direct object (adverb, determiner and two modifiers allowed between), a preposition only where `object_preps` lists it, or a `passive` "<object> was fed"; actions-v1.2 adds `dative` "feeding a grape to the toddler" (fed), chased's CJK forms (追赶 / 追逐 / 追捕 / 追击) and the object-bound base form "calm" (reassured); one re-ask when the judge's picks are not supported by its own quote; two-person + action raw lines pinned into the digest.
- round 3 of #202 (2026-10-31, same `oa-v2.4` prompt; `config.actions_lexicon` = actions-v1.3): split phrasal verbs with the person between ("kicked him out"), negated trust / "took a photo of" (object-bound), "says sorry", "dreaded", "look down upon", "absolve"; "report to" / "to report" dropped, 训练 / "questioning" object-bound; the gate's `relation_ok` (`gate.relation_conflict`) rejects a possessive kin phrase that gives the gold pair a different relation. On every cached judged row with gold picks this flips exactly three passes to fails, all lenient ones the audits flagged: oa-child-grandparent-hug-ba L56 ("her daughter"), oa-bride-caterer-yell-ba L52 ("his bride"), oa-professor-dean-report-ab L60 ("report ... to the Dean"). roles-v1.4: a near role the bank's own stories use for the gold person is no distractor and no conflict for it (local loses shopkeeper, boss manager, troublemaker student; the next near role is drawn: police officer, CEO, bully, which gains an entry); option lists change for those six items only, golds and every other item's options unchanged. A targeted all-layer re-judge of the 8 audited too-strict fails on this code passes 6 (police-thief-ab, detective-suspect-ba, firefighter-homeowner-ab, father-daughter-ab, hairdresser-client-ab, boss-employee-ba); burglar-neighbor-spy-ab stays a judge cannot-tell ('observing' read as not spying).
